Internet Usage Session Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of internet usage sessions, exploring user behaviors and session terminations. It leverages Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Convert start_time and usage_time into appropriate formats.
Handle missing values and correct data types (e.g., upload, download as numeric values).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculate summary statistics for upload, download, and total data transfer.
Group data by user and session break reason.
Data Visualization:

Bar Plots for total uploads/downloads by user.
Box Plots for distribution of upload values.
Scatter Plots for relationships between upload and download speeds.
Pie Charts and Count Plots for session break reasons.
Heatmaps for correlation between variables.
Technologies Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical data handling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Insights:
Identified user behavior and peak usage times.
Analyzed session break reasons to understand common causes for session terminations.
